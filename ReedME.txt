------------------ About -----------------------------------------

*) As per request the system load with 9 different products.

------------------ How To Run -------------------------------------
#Note: We already made 2 repositories that will be auto load when you run the project ("math", "general").
#Note: On Exams folder you can find exams and solutions txt files that we created using the systems.
1. Open Program.java, run the code to open the console menu
2. To view the repositories click 1 and than you will see a menu to the repositories.
3. To create an automatic exam press 2 and than check the repository that you want to use.
4. To create an Manual exam press 2 and than check the repository that you want to use.
5. To save a new repository you must go back to the main manu (pressing -1) and than press 0 to Exit and than type "true" to save your changes.


------------------ Program Logic -----------------------------------
1.On automatic exam the program can not pick a question that have more than one correct answer, only Manual exam can do that
  If the User pick the max amount of questions in the repository to create an automatic exam but one of the question have more than 1 correct answer
  the program will print an error.
2.Exceptions Classes:
  A) MultipleChoiceException.java
  B) NumOfQuestionsException.java
  C) ExamException.java
3. Note that if there are none correct answers the exam will print "none of the answers are correct".
3. Note that if there are more than 1 correct answers the exam will print "More than one answer is correct"
