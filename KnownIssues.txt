1. Command Pattern: 
   According to section 3.1 we used Command Pattern to support 
   express and standard shipping for any company.
   
   #Note:
   On DHLExpressCommand there is a method setNewProduct() that's do nothing.
   The reason for that is, that we want that DHL express can support in the future 
   a calculation for the shipping with product data.
